This project aim to provide a easy approach for demonstrating side Channel Leakage. It has been realized as an demonstration for an Assignement in Zhejiang University for the IoT security class.
## The Code
The Arduino code is originated in https://github.com/qqqlab/microRSA and have been modified to suit my needs.
You can find the code that have been used in the code folder. The file.ino have been uploaded on a Arduino Uno 3. The other files were running with GNU Radio and python on my computer. I used a RTL-SDR RTL2832 avec tuner R820T2 with a 12 cm dipole antenna for acquisition.
Everything was running on Ubuntu 24.02
